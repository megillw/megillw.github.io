I ve studied whales, jellyfish, sea turtles and everything they eat. I m a sea kayaking instructor and was once the mayor of the biggest summertime settlement on the north shore of Queen Charlotte Strait, British Columbia. I ve seen flying fish race ahead of my boat in Baja, Mexico, and avoided a brush with a stone fish diving in the Red Sea. I teach physics, biology, engineering and science communication, oftentimes all in one lecture. My first real job was designing women s underwear, my first scientific publication was a poem, and along the way somewhere I was briefly a professor of geography, but despite graduating 11 PhDs, really I m best known for running a submarine race. I ve been a CEO, a dean and a director of studies, landed a million euros in research grants, published 28 papers and a patent. I ve burned out twice and had a stroke, but they still fear me on the football field. I was an Eagle Scout, a refugee and a short order cook. Now I m nearly fifty and enjoying the living in life.
